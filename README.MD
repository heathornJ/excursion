# Excursion

## Overview

Welcome to my front end software developer task for "excursion". This README file provides information about the content, creation, and learning process involved with creating this webpage.

## Introduction

The intention of this task was to "create a web page which advertises a product called 'Excursion', a mobile app which helps users record and share their experiences".

## Features

### The web page exists on one page, acting as a landing page, with simple text, images and a video displayed.

## Technologies Used

- [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) was used as the foundation of the webpage.
- [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) was used to add the styles and layout of the webpage.
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) was used to write and edit code.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) was used as the version control of the webpage.
- [GitHub](https://github.com/) was used to host the code of the website.

## Deployment

### Deployment to GitHub Pages

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab. - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Main Branch, then click "Save". - The page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
